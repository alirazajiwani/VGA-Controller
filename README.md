# VGA-Controller
This project implements a simulation-based VGA controller that follows the XGA video standard (1024x768 @ 60Hz). The entire system is written in Verilog/SystemVerilog and tested using ModelSim. It provides a simplified yet functional VGA pipeline intended for educational use, pixel-based visual testing, and image display simulation.

## Module Overview

### 1. vga_timing
This module generates the horizontal and vertical synchronization signals (HSYNC and VSYNC) as per XGA specifications:
Handles all timing phases: front porch, sync pulse, back porch, and visible area.
Maintains pixel counters (h_count, v_count) for coordinate tracking.
Outputs a signal indicating the active display region.

### 2. mem_interfacing
Responsible for managing a simulated frame buffer (2D memory array) that stores pixel RGB data.
Input image: a JPG file is converted into hex values using a Python script.
The memory stores RGB values, accessed based on current pixel coordinates from vga_timing.
Image is reconstructed on-screen via RGB output.

### 3. top_module
The top-level integration module that combines:
VGA timing signals
Memory read access
Final RGB output and sync signals (vga_red, vga_green, vga_blue, vga_hsync, vga_vsync, video_enable)

## Simulation
Testbench: Provided to verify functionality and visualize pixel output over time.
Simulation shows VGA timing and correct pixel regeneration based on stored JPG image data.

## Image Pipeline
A JPG image is converted into hex using a Python script.
The hex values are stored in memory and accessed pixel-by-pixel during simulation.
No artificial patternsâ€”just pure reconstruction of the original image from memory.
